## Architecture diagram

At a high level, Mephisto runs its data collection/annotation tasks as shown in this sequence diagram.

## Codebase structure

This is a quick guide over file directories in Mephisto project. Note that some directories include their own `README.md` file with further details.

- `data` - contain local Mephisto database, provider-specific data stores, and worker input collected during Task runs
- `docker` - dockerization setup for Mephisto project
- `docs` - content, config, and build for `Mephisto.ai` docs
    - `legacy` - deprecated doc pages
    - `web` - Docusaurus React app (used to serve doc pages)
        - `blog, docs` - actual content (pages in Markdown format)
        - `other folders` - react app build
- `examples` - Mephisto use cases
    - `form_composer_demo` - FormComposer (FC) examples
        - `data` - JSON configurations for each type of FC setup
        - `hydra_configs/conf` - YAML configurations for related TaskRuns
        - `preview` - simple HTML template (used only for Task Preview on Mturk platform)
        - `webapp` - task's React app containing FC
            - `src` - React code to display FC component (example of using FC plugin in a project)
            - `webpack.config.js` - webpack config for React app containing FC
            - `webpack.config.presigned_urls.js` - webpack config for React app containing FC with presigned S3 URLs feature
            - `webpack.config.review.js` - webpack config for React app displayin read-only task page inside iframe (for TaskReview app)
      - `static_react_task` - simple React application (with Onboarding and Screening)
      - `static_react_task_with_worker_opinion` - simple React application with Worker Opinion widget
      - `simple_static_task` - deprecated example (Mephisto is moving away from HTML templates as its tooling mostly supports React-based tasks)
      - `other examples` - older Mephisto examples (working, but not the best code structure)
- `hydra_configs` - settings for Hydra (Mephisto's configuration tool)
    - `hydra/job_logging` - default YAML config for logging
    - `profile` - "drop-in" configs (can be used in any Task by referencing a profile name in Task launch command with a "+" sign)
- `hydra_plugins` - additional tooling for Hydra
- `mephisto` - main Mephisto project folder
    - `abstractions` - interface to Mephisto primitives, with subfolders containing their implementations for specific cases (e.g. Parlai Chat, Prolific provider, EC2 architect)
    - `client` - collection of CLI tools (e.g. launch TaskReview app, launch FormComposer generator, etc)
        - `cli.py` - contains all supported CLI commands for use with `mephisto â€¦` command
    - `data_model` - classes representing core Mephisto objects
    - `generators` - Mephisto apps generating code for Task apps based on their configuration
        - `form_composer` - builds React app for form-based tasks (based on specific provided FC JSON config files), and launches a server to display task units in a browser
    - `operations` - part of core Mephisto code
    - `review_app` - builds React app for TaskReview, and launches a server to display TaskReview in a browser
- `outputs` - exhaust produced by running the code (logs, database dumps, etc)
- `packages` - npm packages (can be used locally, and some are also in npm repo)
    - `mephisto-addons` - package with FC React component
- `scripts` - command-line utilities for code upkeep
- `test` - All tests (Back-end and Front-end, Unittests and Integration tests)
