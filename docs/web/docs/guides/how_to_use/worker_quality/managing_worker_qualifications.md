# Managing worker qualifications

To make qualifying workers easier we prepared UI in [TaskReview app](/docs/guides/how_to_use/review_app/overview/). 
How to install and run this application you can find the information in section [Run TaskReview app](/docs/guides/how_to_use/review_app/running/).

# Worker Qualifications

On the main page in the tab "Worker Qualifications" you can:
- see already granted qualifications to your workers
- create a new qualification
- filter and sort worker qualifications
- edit value of granted qualification or revoke this qualification from a worker
- open qualification page
- open unit page
