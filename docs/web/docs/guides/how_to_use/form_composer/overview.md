# FormComposer overview

You can easily generate form-based Tasks using our FormComposer task generator feature. It produces clean cross-platform Bootstrap forms with client-side form validation.

## Live demo

You can find working demos of FormComposer in `examples/form_composer_demo` repo directory.

For details on how to run these examples, refer to the demo's [README.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mephisto/blob/main/examples/form_composer_demo/README.md)
