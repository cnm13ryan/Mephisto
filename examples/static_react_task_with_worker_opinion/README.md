# Simple Static React Task with Worker Opinion

This task is essentially the same as the `static-react-task` task except that there is a worker opinon form after finishing a Task. 

The [static-react-task README](../static_react_task/README.md) should be read before running this task.

### Adding `WorkerOpinion` widget

To see how to add this widget, read [mephisto-addons README](packages/mephisto-addons/README.md)

Once a worker submits an opinion from the form below the main task that will be available to the researcher in TaskReview app.
There is a page with all opinions for a Task and "Worker Opinion" collapsable block on Unit review page if a worker left their opinion.
