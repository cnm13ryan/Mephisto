<div>
  This is the target image that we want to closely reproduce by providing text
  prompts<br />

  <img class="custom--task-image" src="{{target_image}}" alt="" /><br />

  <ul>
    <li>
      Below you will provide detailed text prompts instructing an algorithm to
      generate a similar-looking image.
    </li>
    <li>
      After each attempt you will score the resemblance between the generated
      and the target images
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the likeliness score reaches 10 (perfect), or a time/attempts limit
      is reached, the task will finish.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can also finish task results early by clicking "Exit" - but that will
      lower the quality of your submission.
    </li>
  </ul>
